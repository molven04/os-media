For Featured video contents based on the latest HTML5 Video-js library (5.2.1). It works with local & remote media, Amazon S3, Youtube & Vimeo. 

== Description ==

OS-media allow streaming of mp4/webm/ogv video progressively through PHP. It works with all WP themes, but is designed specifically for **OS-media theme**, a Twenty Fourteen Child Theme that is able to properly handle the layout of Custom Post for Featured Videos.

**DEMO ONLINE:** http://openstream.tv/demo/

**OS-media WP theme:** http://www.mariomarino.eu/os-media-wordpress-theme/

You can insert multimedia content:

* in normal post or page with the classic **shortcodes** added to the post textarea through control panel.
* in **Custom Post Type for "Featured Video"**, a dedicated area where we have a single "Featured video" for each page (like WP Featured Images). 

There are 5 ways to insert video:

1. from local WP installation (after upload video files through FTP): you must place the **PATH** of this local video resource (for example: /opt/lampp/htdocs/wp/wp-content/uploads/video)in general settings and files list appears in **file selector** in each control panel of single post.
2. from any file server or WP installation: you must place the URL (http://...) and files list appears in **file selector**.
3. from **Amazon S3** (Simple Storage Server) [files list appears in **file selector**],
4. directly uploading (or selecting) files through WordPress **media uploader** (limited size: depends on the configuration of php and WP) [dedicated input for each format: mp4, webm, ogg]
5. from the platform **Youtube & Vimeo**. [dedicated input]

>NOTE: **the way 1 is recommended** if you need to hide the video URL and prevents users from easily downloading the source.

> For **OSmedia Featured video (Custom Post Type)**, if you don't use **Os-media theme** you can insert the function **Osmedia_video()** in your theme. This content are also optimized for latest WP theme like Twenty Fifteen or Twenty Fourteen, automatically detected by this plugin, which loads the dedicated layout for CPT content. If your theme is not recognized, is loaded by default the file **layout/osmedia_cpt.php**, that you can edit and customize for display your featured video.

For normal post/page you can place **Poster Image for video** URL in shortcode (img="").<br>
In custom Post Field you can use the WP Featured Image, otherwise the plugin try to load image file from the same directory with the same name and .jpg extension.

Some configs parameters in **Option settings** are **general config**, not present in single-post settings, this one are effective for post already created (for example: "local video path", or "player skin"). And some other config parameters for **default setting** that are overwritten by the same settings parameters present in single-post (for example: "width", or "autoplay").

**List of all parameters of OS-media video:**

**Shortcode example:**

`[video file=”demo” fileurl="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/” img="http://.." youtube="KTRVYDwfDyU" width="640" height="360"]`

You can customize you own **Video-js skin** player simply generating css file through this tool: http://codepen.io/heff/pen/EarCt.
After that upload this file in the plugin folder: player/videojs/skin. The file name should reflect the name of the main class of the css file (not including the extension .css).
